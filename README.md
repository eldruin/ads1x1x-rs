This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the ADS1013, ADS1014, ADS1015,
ADS1113, ADS1114 and ADS1115 ultra-small, low-power
analog-to-digital converters (ADC), based on the [`embedded-hal`] traits.

[Introductory blog post]

This driver allows you to:
- Set the operating mode to one-shot or continuous. See `Ads1115::into_continuous`.
- Make a measurement in one-shot mode. See `Ads1115::read`.
- Start continuous conversion mode. See `Ads1115::start`.
- Read the last measurement made in continuous conversion mode. See `Ads1115::read`.
- Set the data rate. See `Ads1115::set_data_rate`.
- Set the full-scale range (gain amplifier). Se `Ads1115::set_full_scale_range`.
- Read whether a measurement is in progress. See `Ads1115::is_measurement_in_progress`.
- Set the ALERT/RDY pin to be used as conversion-ready pin. See `Ads1115::use_alert_rdy_pin_as_ready`.
- Comparator:
    - Set the low and high thresholds. See `Ads1115::set_high_threshold_raw`.
    - Set the comparator mode. See `Ads1115::set_comparator_mode`.
    - Set the comparator polarity. See `Ads1115::set_comparator_polarity`.
    - Set the comparator latching. See `Ads1115::set_comparator_latching`.
    - Set the comparator queue. See `Ads1115::set_comparator_queue`.
    - Disable the comparator. See `Ads1115::disable_comparator`.

## The devices

The devices are precision, low power, 12/16-bit analog-to-digital
converters (ADC) that provide all features necessary to measure the most
common sensor signals in an ultra-small package. Depending on the device,
these  integrate a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), voltage reference,
oscillator and high-accuracy temperature sensor.

The devices can perform conversions at data rates up to 3300 samples per
second (SPS). The PGA offers input ranges from ±256 mV to ±6.144 V,
allowing both large and small signals to be measured with high resolution.
An input multiplexer (MUX) allows to measure two differential or four
single-ended inputs. The high-accuracy temperature sensor can be used for
system-level temperature monitoring or cold-junction compensation for
thermocouples.

The devices operate either in continuous-conversion mode, or in a
single-shot mode that automatically powers down after a conversion.
Single-shot mode significantly reduces current consumption during idle
periods. Data is transferred through I²C.

Here is a comparison of the caracteristics of the devices:

| Device  | Resolution | Sample Rate  | Channels | Multi-channel | Features        |
|---------|------------|--------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| ADS1013 | 12-bit     | Max 3300 SPS | 1        | N/A           |                 |
| ADS1014 | 12-bit     | Max 3300 SPS | 1        | N/A           | Comparator, PGA |
| ADS1015 | 12-bit     | Max 3300 SPS | 4        | Multiplexed   | Comparator, PGA |
| ADS1113 | 16-bit     | Max 860 SPS  | 1        | N/A           |                 |
| ADS1114 | 16-bit     | Max 860 SPS  | 1        | N/A           | Comparator, PGA |
| ADS1115 | 16-bit     | Max 860 SPS  | 4        | Multiplexed   | Comparator, PGA |

## Usage

To use this driver, import this crate and an `embedded_hal` implementation,
then instantiate the appropriate device.
In the following examples an instance of the device ADS1013 will be created
as an example.

Please find additional examples using hardware in this repository: [driver-examples]

[driver-examples]: https://github.com/eldruin/driver-examples

```rust
use ads1x1x::{channel, Ads1013, TargetAddr};
use linux_embedded_hal::I2cdev;
use nb::block;

fn main() {
    let i2c = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
    let mut adc = Ads1013::new(i2c, TargetAddr::default());

    let value = block!(adc.read(channel::DifferentialA0A1)).unwrap();
    println!("Measurement: {}", value);

    // Get the I2C peripheral back.
    let i2c = adc.release();
    drop(i2c);
}
```
